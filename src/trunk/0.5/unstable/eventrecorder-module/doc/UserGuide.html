        <p>
            The event recorder appears as a pair of vertically-conjoined pyramids. The recorder uses a metaphor of 'tapes'
            on which recordings are stored. To create a new tape on which to record, or to select an existing tape to over-record,
            select the <b>Open Tape...</b> item from the recorder's context menu. The operations in the resulting dialogue
            box are fairly self-evident. To add a new 'tape', click on the <b>Add...</b> button and provide a name for a new tape.
            To select a tape to be over-recorded, click it in the list of tapes. Finally, close the dialogue box by clicking
            on the <b>Done</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start recording, click on the upper red pyramid of the recorder. It will rotate to indicate that a recording is
            taking place. To stop recording, click again on the upper red pyramid, at which point it should stop rotating.
        </p>
