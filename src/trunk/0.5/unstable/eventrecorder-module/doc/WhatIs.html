<h1>Overview of Event Recorder and Event Player modules</h1>
<p>
The event recorder and player modules provide a mechanism to record and playback the activites that
have taken place in a Project Wonderland virtual world. This includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Avatar movement</li>
<li>Addition and removal of objects (cells)</li>
<li>Changes in the state of objects in world</li>
<li>Audio</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, at present we are not able to record changes to all objects in the world.
For example, the shared X11-based applications cannot be recorded.
However, we are able to record and replay changes to other shared applications,
such as the whiteboard and sticky notes.
</p>

<p>
The recording and playback is provided by two modules: the Event Recorder module records activity
and the Event Player replays previously recorded activities.
</p>
