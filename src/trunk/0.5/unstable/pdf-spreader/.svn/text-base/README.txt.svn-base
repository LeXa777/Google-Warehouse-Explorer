How to use the PDF Spreader:

Firstly, you must deploy the wonderland-presentation-base module to the wonderland server, before
deploying this module.

The module will not appear in the cell/component palette.

Drag and drop a PDF or a URI pointing to a PDF into the wonderland client window.

If the PDFviewer is also installed you will be asked to select between this module (the PDF spreader) and
the PDF viewer.
