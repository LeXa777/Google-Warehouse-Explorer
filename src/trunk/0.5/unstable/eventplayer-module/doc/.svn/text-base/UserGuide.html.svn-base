<p>
The event player appears as an upturned pyramid surmounted by a horizontal plinth.
The recorder uses a metaphor of 'tapes' on which recordings are stored.
To select an existing tape to replay, 
select the <b>Open Tape...</b> item from the recorder's context menu; 
this will open a dialogue box from which a previous recording may be selected. 
Close the dialogue box by clicking on the <b>Done</b> button.
        </p>

<p>
Having selected a recording, the objects that were in the world at the beginning of the
recording are added to the world. A green pyramid will appear on top of the event player to indicate
that all the objects have been added and that the recording can be replayed. To replay the recording,
click on the upper green pyramid. It will rotate to indicate that a replay is taking place. 
To pause replaying, click again on the upper green pyramid, at which point it should stop rotating.
To restart replaying, click again on the upper green pyramid.</p>

<p>
When the replay has completed, the upper green pyramid will retreat into the event player. At this point,
you may select another recording to replay.</p>
