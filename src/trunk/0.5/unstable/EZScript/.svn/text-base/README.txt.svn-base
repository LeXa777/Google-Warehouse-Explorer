Included in the EZScript module is a shell script called: NewModule
NewModule can be used to create...you guessed it...a new Open Wonderland module with files and directory structure included.

****************
Usage: ./NewModule /path/to/new/module/you/wish/to/create/

Notes: It is important to note that those wishing to utilize NewModule will still need to open the new netbeans project that
gets created and edit the project.xml, build.xml, and my.module.properties as needed. Also, one will likely need to refactor the
package name from 'sample' to a new package as reflected in my.module.properties.
