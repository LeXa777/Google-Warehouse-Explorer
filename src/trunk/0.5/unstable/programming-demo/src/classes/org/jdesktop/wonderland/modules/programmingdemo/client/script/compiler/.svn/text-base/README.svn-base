This ZIP archive contains the source code and compiled code for the javaxtools.compiler
package and sample Plotter Swing application. This code accompanies the developerWorks article 
"Create dynamic applications with javax.tools" http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/j-jcomp/
by David J. Biesack.

ZIP archive file content directories:

  src    - the Java source code for the javaxtools.compiler API and the Plotter sample application
  target - generated jar and compiled classes
  docs   - documentation. The Javadoc for both javaxtools.compiler and the example Plotter Swing
           application is in the api subdirectory.

To run the sample:

1) Create a directory such as ~/javaxtools.compiler or c:\javaxtools.compiler
The instructions below will use c:\javaxtools.compiler as an example

2) Unpack the ZIP file to c:\javaxtools.compiler

3) Download JFreeChart from http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/
   You need two jars from the JFreeChart distribution:

  jfreechart-1.0.6.jar or a later compatible version from SourceForge
  project download page at 
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15494
  
  The JFreeChart distribution also includes a required a jcommon-1.0.10.jar
  
  JFreeChart is distributed under the GNU Lesser Public License but is
  not included in this developerWorks distribution.

4) Extract the JFreeChart jars from the JFreeChart distribution and copy
   the jars to c:\javaxtools.compiler\target . Rename the JFreeChart
   jars by removing the explicit version number from the file name
   (i.e. rename jfreechart-1.0.6.jar as jfreechart.jar and rename
   jcommon-1.0.10.jar as jcommon.jar). This allows easy replacement
   of the JFreeChart implementation with later releases without
   having to change the Class-Path: attribute in the
   javaxtools.compiler.jar manifest.
   
   You should now have three jars in that directory:

   c:\javaxtools.compiler\target\javaxtools.compiler.jar
   c:\javaxtools.compiler\target\jfreechart.jar
   c:\javaxtools.compiler\target\jcommon.jar
   
5) Change to the c:\javaxtools.compiler\target directory and execute the jar file

   java -jar javaxtools.compiler.jar
  
   or double click the jar file if you have a file association for executable jar files.

   If the application does not run, ensure that tools.jar from the the JDK is in the
   CLASSPATH. This is automatically in the CLASSPATH if you run java from
   the JDK distribution; i.e. on windows

    c:\path-to-your-installed-java6-jdk\bin\java -jar javaxtools.compiler.jar
  
   Note that tools.jar is not in the CLASSPATH if you run java from a JRE
   distribution (which includes c:\windows\system32\java.exe if you
   ran a JRE installer for Microsoft Windows operating systems).
