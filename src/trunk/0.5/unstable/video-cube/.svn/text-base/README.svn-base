Video Cube Example

This cell is an example of how to render video onto arbitrary surfaces using
the code from the OpenWonderland video player module. Before installing this
module, make sure the latest version of the videoplayer module is installed as
well.

To use this module, you will need to hard-code the set of videos to play.
The videos are set up in
src/classes/org/jdesktop/wonderland/modules/videocube/client/VideoCubeCell.java.
They may be specified using any valid OpenWonderland URL type, including
http://, wlcontent:// or wla://. The videos may be of any type supported by
the video player.

Rendering of video on the surface is done by the VideoCubeRenderer. In
particular, the compute() method of the VideoProcessor resamples the video
to the correct format to prepare it for display. The commit() method of
the processor updates a texture with the video data.
