This module can load scenes from CMU's educational IDE Alice into the
virtual world.

REQUIREMENTS:

You will need a running Wonderland server, and a copy of Alice 3
(http://kenai.com/projects/alice/downloads).

BINARY INSTALLATION:

If you downloaded the CMU module as a binary cmu-module.jar file, you
can use the Wonderland web administration UI to install the module.
On the Wonderland server administration page, select "Manage Modules".
At the top of the page you will be able to specify the module to install,
and upload the module to the server. Once the module is uploaded,
continute to the configuration step below.

SOURCE INSTALLATION:

If you have a copy of the wonderland-modules source code, the CMU
module can be found in the wonderland-modules/unstable/cmu-module
directory. Check that the cmu.module.properties is configured correctly
(see the file for more information on how to configure it). With the
Wonderland server running, run 'ant deploy' in the module directory
to install the module on your server. Alternately, you can use
"ant dist" to build the module binary in the dist/ directory, and install it
as described above.

CONFIGURE THE CMU SERVER COMPONENT:

Go to the Manage Server page on the web interface (in the
Server Administration section), click "edit" in the top left next to
"Server Components", and then choose "Add Component."
Enter the following:

Component Name: CMU Runner
Component Class: org.jdesktop.wonderland.modules.cmu.weblib.CMUPlayerRunner
Location: Local

Choose OK, then Save. Click "Restart All" to ensure that all components are
up and running.

COPY THE ALICE ARTWORK:

The Alice 3 gallery must be copied to a place where it is accessible to the CMU
module.

To obtain the gallery, install Alice 3 (http://kenai.com/projects/alice/downloads).
The gallery will be installed in the Alice 3 installation directory in a subdirectory
named "gallery". Copy this entire directory to the CMU module directory.

The CMU module directory can be found on the Wonderland server in the user's
home directory, in a subdirectory called .wonderland-server/0.5-dev/run/cmu_runner.
The gallery would be created as a subdirectory of the cmu_runner directory.

Alice 3 can be safely uninstalled after the gallery is copied.

DRAG AND DROP ALICE FILES:

Now that the server is configured, you can simply drag and drop .a3p files generated
in Alice 3 into your Wonderland client.

You can see status and errors from the CMU module in the server administration web UI.
Under the "Manage Server" section, you can see a line for the "CMU Runner", which
lets you view the log for the CMU server components.
