Marbleous is a physics simulation that models a marble rolling down a track. 
After each marble run, you can examine the physical forces and properties of 
the marble at any given time in the run. 
The goal of the application is to help you understand how phenomena such as velocity, 
acceleration, potential energy, and kinetic energy change over time and with different 
track configurations.
</p>


<h2>Setup</h2>


<p>
<em>Note:</em> These instructions assume that the Marbleous module has been installed
 on your Wonderland server.
</p>


Before inserting an instance of Marbleous into your Wonderland world, 
turn off Avatar Collision using <b>Tools&gt;Avatar Collision Response Enabled</b>. 
Next, select <b>Insert&gt;Object</b>, click on  the Marbleous item in the Object window, 
and click <b>Insert</b>. Your avatar will be positioned on the track. 
Navigate away from the track so that you can see the top of the beginning of the track. 
You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom your view in and out. 
It may also be helpful to hold down the Control key while dragging your mouse to look up and down. 

<h2><img style="width: 211px; height: 387px;" alt="Marbleous Control Panel" src="MarbleousControlPanel.png" align="right">Running and Reviewing the Marble Simulation</h2>

<p>Press the <b>Run</b> button in the Marbleous Control Panel.</p>

<p>
The marble will roll down the track. Once it has run down the track and either 
fallen off or stopped moving, press the <b>Stop</b> button in the Control Panel. 
A Time Slider panel will open. This allows you to examine the details of the last 
run of the marble along the track. The initial state of the slider is time = 0, 
i.e. the marble is back at the beginning of the track. By moving the slider to the right, 
the position of the marble is updated according to its last run along the track.
</p>

<p>
Experiment with moving the slider to see the position of marble. As an example, 
move the slider so that the marble is about to enter the upward slope of the loop. 
Click on the marble, to display details of the position of the marble, and the time 
at which it reached this position. (You may need to move the position of your avatar 
to get a good view of this.)
</p>

Now click in the details pane. This expands the box to include additional details of the 
marble such as its velocity, acceleration, potential and kinetic energy 
(Note: you may need to click a few times to get the expanded details to show up). 
Click again on the details to see an illustration of the equations that provide the results. 
At this stage, you can click again on the marble or on the details to dismiss them, 
or return to the time slider to modify the position of the marble. Alternatively, 
SHIFT-click on the details to cause them to be retained in position. (The border 
of the details will turn blue. Should you wish to dismiss the details, SHIFT click 
again to remove the blue border.) Whilst the details are shown with a blue border, 
adjust the time slider to show the marble at its peak in the loop, and click on the 
marble to show the details of the marble at that position. Click on the details to 
reveal extra information and compare the kinetic and potential energy of the marble 
when at the peak of the loop with that when it enters the loop. SHIFT-click on these 
details so that they are retained.

<p>

Now, adjust the time slider so that the marble is just about to leave the loop 
and enter the first level segment. Click on the marble to reveal its details 
and then click once on those details to expand them. Now compare the details 
of the marble in all three positions. Note how the potential and kinetic energy changes, 
and how much total energy is lost by the marble as it goes through the loop.
</p>

<p>
Experiment with the Time Slider and viewing the details of the marble.
</p>

<h2>Resetting and Re-Running the Simulation</h2>

<p>
Once you have completed reviewing the marble simulation, you should
reset the simulation to its starting state by clicking on the <b>Reset</b>
button in the Marbleous Control Panel HUD. The physics system may also
be reset by checking the <b>Reset Physics</b> check box; if this checkbox is
not selected, consecutive runs of the marble simulation are based on
the results of earlier simulations.
</p>

<h2>Modifying the Track</h2>

<p>
You may modify the track in two ways: adding and removing segments
of track; or editing the properties of a segment of track. We'll cover
each of these in turn. The track should <strong>NOT BE MODIFIED</strong> when the
simulation is running.
</p>

<h2>Adding and Removing Segments of Track</h2>

<p>
To remove a segment of track, select the track segment in the lower
list of track segments of the Marbleous Control Panel and click on the <b>Remove</b> button.
To add a segment of track, select a segment type from the upper list of
the HUD and click the Add button. A new segment of track, matching the
selected type, is added to the end of the track.
</p>

<h2>Editing the Properties of a Segment of Track</h2>

<p>To edit the properties of a track segment, first select it from the
lower list of track segments, and then click on the <b>Edit...</b> button. 
The "Segment Editor" will appear. This contains a table
of the "knots" in the segment, plus any other properties of the segment
that may be edited (for example, the Loop has a <em>radius</em> property). The
"knots" of a segment are a mathematical way of describing it, each knot
has the following <a href="http://www.cubic.org/docs/hermite.htm">attributes</a>:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Tension: How sharply does the curve
bend?</li>
  <li>Continuity: How rapid is the change in speed and direction?
  </li>
  <li>Bias: What is the direction of the curve?
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
The segment editor presents each segment as a table of knots, with the
rows of the table corresponding to each knot. You can edit the
values of the knot, including its position, its rotation, tension, bias
and continuity. (Tooltips are provided to hint at the accepted values
for each of these attributes.) Experiment with changing these values,
and click <b>Save</b> when you are done to save your values. If you click the
<b>Restore</b> button, the original values of the segment will be restored.
When you're finished editing, simply close the window.
