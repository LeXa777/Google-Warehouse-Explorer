<p>
The Movie Recorder, shown to the right, provides two buttons by which you
can record movies or take snapshots (still frames).
To position the movie recorder, use the standard affordance tools accessible via the
<b>Edit...</b> item from the context menu.
</p>

  
<p>
To take a snapshot, simply click on the blue button. The image will be
stored as a JPG file on your local hard drive. The name of the file will be 'Wonderland_' appended
with a timestamp, and its location depends on your platform, as follows:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Windows: <em>My Documents\My Pictures</em></li>
<li>Macintosh: <em>Pictures</em></li>
<li>Linux/Gnome: <em>Documents</em></li>
<li>Other: User's home directory</li>
</ul>


<p>
To take a movie, click on the red button--you should hear a single beep--this will begin the recording.
To end the recording, click again on the red button--you should hear a double beep. A notification message
will appear in the top right of the Project Wonderland window when the movie has been saved as a Quicktime
MOV file on your local hard drive. Much like taking a snapshot, the name of the file will be 'Wonderland_' appended
with a timestamp, and its location depends on your platform, as follows:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Windows: <em>MyDocuments\My Videos</em></li>
<li>Macintosh: <em>Movies</em></li>
<li>Linux/Gnome: <em>Videos</em></li>
<li>Other: User's home directory</li>
</ul>


<p>When not in use, we suggest turning off the Movie Recorder as it can have a 
significant impact on the client's frame rate. The <em>standby</em> icon at the lower right of the viewfinder can be used to turn the Movie Recorder off and on. (Note: the Movie Recorder will not record movies nor take snapshots whilst turned off.)
</p>

<p><img style="width: 411px; height: 308px;" alt="Movie Recorder HUD" src="HUD.png" align="right">For more advanced features, open the <em>Heads Up Display</em> (HUD) for the Movie Recorder,
(shown on the right) via the context menu item labelled <b>Open HUD Control Panel</b>. The HUD provides
an ideal way of taking a snapshot or recording a movie of yourself.</p>


<p>From the HUD, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Change the location to which snapshots will be saved (by clicking on the <b>Select...</b> button 
to the right of the text field containing the pictures directory)</li>
<li>Change the location to which movies will be saved</li>
<li>Take a snapshot</li>
<li>Start and stop a movie recording</li>
<li>Turn the movie recorder off and on</li>
</ul>
