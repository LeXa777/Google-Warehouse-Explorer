<div id="sectionDescription">Open Wonderland supports two types of in-world 2D applications. One type is multi-user Java apps and the other type is single-user X11 apps. X11 apps are applications that run on Linux. Every Wonderland installation has a different set of 2D applications, depending on what apps, known as modules, are installed on your server.</div>

To see what applications you have available, select "Object" from the Insert menu. Select one of the 2D choices, such as Sticky Note, and click "Insert."

<div id="stepNoHang">
The application will appear just in front of your avatar, so remember to stand near the spot where you want to place the application.

Almost all 2D applications work the same way. Right-click on the application and select "Take Control" from the context menu.
<div id="pix"><img src="2DApps/Sticky-TakeControl.png" width="200px"></div>
<div id="stepNoHang">
With the exception of X11 apps, most 2D applications allow multiple people to "take control" at the same time. Taking control allows you to edit content or interact with the application.

<img src="BlueNumbers/Blue-3.png" align="top">
Now click in the window to interact. Many apps, such as the Whiteboard, have a tool palette that will appear at the bottom of your screen on your <i>HUD</i>, which stands for Heads-Up Display. Think of the HUD as a glass pane in front of your 3D world.
<div id="pix"><img src="2DApps/WhiteboardSelectRect.png" width="200px"></div>
<div id="stepNoHang">
With the Whiteboard, you can use the tools to draw text, boxes, lines, and circles. Each app, however, has a different set of tools.</div>

<div id="step">

When you are finished interacting with an app, click "Release App Control" in the upper right corner of your screen.
<div id="pix"><img src="2DApps/ReleaseWhiteboardControl.png" width="200px">
</div>
<div id="stepNoHang">
Notice that the window border is green when you have control and red when you do not.<br><br>
You cannot move your avatar when you have control of a 2D application because all keyboard input goes to the application rather than to the world.

<!--       TIPS SECTION -->

<div id="sectionHead">Tips</div>
<div id="tipName">Using X11 Applications</div>
<div id="tip">
There are several differences to keep in mind when using X11 applications such as Firefox, Open Office, or NetBeans. First, these are single-user apps. Only one person can control the app at a time. This person's name is displayed in the upper right corner of the app window. 
<div id="tipPix"><img src="2DApps/Firefox.png" width="200px"></div>
Second, all the tools for these apps exist within the in-world app and not in palettes on your HUD.<br><br>
Third, you can resize an X11 app when you have control by using the resize corners.

<div id="tipName">Getting the Best View</div>
<div id="tip">To see an application up close or while you're navigating around, right-click and select "Show in HUD." To have it fill the screen, use "Best View." In Best View, scroll to zoom in and out.
<div id="tipPix"><img src="2DApps/PDFinHUD.png" width="200px"></div>
</div>

<div id="tipName">Unsticking Your Avatar</div>
<div id="tip">If you can't move, you probably forgot to click "Release App Control."
<div id="tipPix"><img src="2DApps/ReleaseAppControl.png"></div>
If that doesn't unstick you, try selecting "Avatar Collision Response Enabled" from the Tools menu to turn off collision.
